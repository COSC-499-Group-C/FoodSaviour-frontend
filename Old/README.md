# Team GitHub Exercise
- In this exercise, our group came up with a small programming project in order to test our knowledge on GitHub, create a workflow we can use on our client project, and get used to an agile software development environment. 
- Our project contains a variety of basic math functions, where the user can input some integers and get a corresponding output based on the operation being performed.

## Feature Description
- division(): Takes any number of numeric user inputs and outputs the subsequent divided outcome 
- summation(): adds all given numbers together and returns the sum
- product(): multiplies all given numbers together and returns the product
- power(): takes two integers and then calculates/returns the result, where the first int is the base and second int is the power
- Cube(): Takes an input and outputs the cube of that input.
- Remainder(): Takes divisor and divdend as the input and provides the remainder for it. The first input is dividend and the second input is divisor. Also this function makes sure that "0" is not accepted as the input for the second number from user.

## How to use the functions
- Sum & Product: After running the python file in the command line, you will be prompted to enter any number of positive integers, and to enter after each number. To complete your stream of numbers, enter 0. You will then be prompted to choose whether to get the SUM of the numbers, or the PRODUCT. Entering either will result in the corresponding answer being returned.
- Power: After running the python file in the command line, you will be prompted to enter two positive integers, and enter after each number. Once the two numbers are entered, the answer will be returned.
- Cube: After executing the cube file/program, the user will be prompted to enter a number. Hit 'Enter' once the user has input their number of choice. The output will display automatically on the next line. The output shows the cube of the number that the user has entered.
- Division: After running the python file from the command line, you will be prompted to enter any number of integers, press enter after each. If an invalid input is recognized, it will prompt you to try again. To finish the program, enter 0 and the divided outcome of each number after the last will output.
- Remainder: Run the python file in an IDE or commmand line. It will prompt the user to enter 2 integers. The first integer would be the dividend and the second one will be the divisor. The input is provided the program will give out the remainder as the result and finish running.
